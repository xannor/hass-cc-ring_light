# hass-ring_light
Ring Light custom component for Home Assistant

## Usage

```
light:
- platform: ring_light
```

This will use/require the regular ring setup so you must have that configured properly first.

## Info

This is base off of code published in https://community.home-assistant.io/t/ring-floodlight-cam-turn-floodlight-on-and-off/75761/8
modified to work as a HACS addon, since it seems that it is not going to be integrated any time soon.
